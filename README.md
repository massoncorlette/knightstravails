Focusing on working with a graph of vertices, using a searching algorithm to find shortest path for horse chess piece to a chosen coordinate

We must find the shortest path from starting coordinate and ending coordinate, and 
return all the moves in between. 

Some parameters to consider:
- Piece should not go off of board

- Piece landing on target coordinate could be base case

- Need a searching algorithm to find shortest path

- Can either get height from stored moves array height or
have the height be returned recursively

Pseudo:

make the 2D graph of coordinates for the board

knightMoves(start,end)

  if the coordinates to move is out of bounds, return -1

  if the coordinates to move is on target, return -1

  add a move
